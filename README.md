I am an Android & Web developer with a deep passion for learning new technologies and helping others in learning and solving their problems.
I have previously worked as a full-stack developer and a frontend developer. But I have been a mobile developer since 2018.
I always pay attention to the smallest details and I’m looking for new ways to challenge myself on all occasions, both in my professional and personal life.
